### 🔍 About Me
I'm Steve — a hands-on learner driven by curiosity in how systems work under the hood. I build, break, fix, and secure things. My focus is in:

- 🕷 **Web App Security** – OWASP Top 10, real-world exploitation, red teaming  
- 🧠 **Backend Development** – Node.js, Express, MongoDB, Auth, API design  
- ⚙️ **Systems Programming** – Low-level C, file systems, memory, processes  
- 🌐 **Networking** – TCP/IP, HTTP, custom tools, sockets, fuzzing

---

### 🚧 Currently Building

- 🔐 `Safe_Zone` – Secure Node.js backend from scratch w/ JWT, cookies, validation  
- 🕸 `Old Wounds` – Anon message-sharing app (auth, journaling, emotional UX)  
- 💬 `NodeBuddies` – Community journaling space with real-time support  
- 📩 Email bot – Node.js-based SMTP bot for sending custom messages

### 📂 Projects & Learning

I learn by building — every repo here is either a tool, experiment, or a playground to push limits in security, automation, or system control.

Check out my repositories for:

- ✅ Full-stack projects (auth, sessions, cookies, APIs)
- 🔍 Web security experiments (SSRF, IDOR, fuzzing)
- 🛠 Custom CLI tools in C & JavaScript

### 🧠 Goals

- 🎯 Become a Web App Security Engineer  
- 📜 Earn certs: `eWPT`, `PNPT`, then `OSWE`  
- 🔧 Build my own custom C2 and web fuzzer  
- 🧪 Create a personal AI chatbot trained on my own data/emotions
