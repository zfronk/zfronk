### About Me

Hey, I’m Steve. I like understanding how systems really work not just at the surface, but deep down. I’m into breaking things just to learn how to fix and improve them. Right now, I’m sharpening my skills in:
* IT infrastrature understanding
* Web App Security – OWASP Top 10, real-world vulnerabilities, red team mindset
* Backend Development – Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWTs, cookies, API design
* Systems Programming – Writing low-level tools in C, messing with memory and files
* Networking Basics – Protocols like HTTP & TCP/IP, simple fuzzers, building from scratch

---

### What I'm Building

* NodeBuddies – A journaling app with user auth, session handling, and a focus on anonymous support. All backend logic is custom-built in Node.js.

---

### Tools I Use

**Languages:** `C (Foundational)`, `C# (Before)`, `Python (Before)`, `JavaScript`, `Bash`, `HTML/CSS`
**Stack:** `Node.js`, `Express`, `MongoDB`
**Environment:** Daily driver is `Linux Mint`, work in terminal, use `Micro`, `VS Code`, and Git

### Projects = My Learning Process

I build small tools and apps to understand things better from system calls in C to full-stack login flows. Most of my repos are experiments, not finished products. You’ll find:

* Auth systems with sessions and tokens
* Web app security testing playgrounds
* Simple C programs for file access, memory, and user input

### What I’m Aiming For
* Get IT Certified for IT Support role
