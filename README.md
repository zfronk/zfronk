### About Me
I’ve always enjoyed working with computers and figuring out how things work. Over time, that interest pushed me into learning more about IT, networks, and even building small web apps on my own. I like troubleshooting, finding solutions, and picking up new skills as I go.

Right now, I’m working toward starting out in IT Support, where I can use what I know, keep learning on the job, and grow into a reliable IT professional.

### What I’m Aiming For
* Get IT Certified for IT Support role
